            <p>Vandelay Rentals is a rental reservations and inventory management app built with a local kayak and paddleboard rental business in mind. It incorporates payments via Stripe, legal documentation via Hello Sign, inventory and user data management via React Table, user authentication (server-side and client-side), a custom calendar, and advanced CSS techniques. This was my group's final project for coding boot camp.</p>
            <p>To avoid interfering with each other or inadvertently modifying (i.e. breaking) working code, we created sandbox page components for each of us to work in. These sandboxes are still present in the project for demo purposes, but they can only be accessed if you're signed in as a dev.</p>

            <p>Mind Over Money is a money management app that offers detailed records and an at-a-glance summary of balances and trends. It allows you to record monthly bills, credit card payments, savings deposits, and checking and credit card expenses.</p>
            <p>It is customizable in that you name your accounts, you decide how many accounts you wish to track, how many bills you wish to track, and which categories of expenses you wish to track. Categories can be tracked regardless of which spending method you use (checking, which credit card, etc.). It also averages expenses by month. Login with user 'Demo' and pw 'cangetin'</p>

            <p>Event Vaark was the first group project for my coding boot camp. It is a movie &amp; event search app that draws on The Movie DB and Eventful APIs. It lets you search for movies by name and events by name or location and then save the ones you don't want to miss. The primary challenges were AJAX requests and Firebase. We also spent some time learning the basics of Green Sock animations.</p>
            <p>This is only a demo version - logins are not available, though we did have it on our list of features for future development, along with notifications when movies are released or event tickets go on sale.</p>

            <p>Dragon Writer is a customizable drag-and-drop app with a rich text editor and image storyboarding. It was conceived as a rearrangeable storboarding tool for writing fiction, but I realized by making it customizable it could be used for any writing project, or even just a to-do list, if thatâ€™s all you need.</p>
            <p>In additionn to MERN stack, this project is built with react-beautiful-dnd and slate.js. Current development includes smoother user experience when logging in, a landing page, a tutorial, and a public-facing page where you can publish whatever pieces you wish, whether as a blog, serial fiction, or whatever else you can make of it. Login with user 'Demo' and pw 'cangetin'.</p>

            <p>Ask Liri is a Command Line Interface (CLI) Node app that interacts via the backend with three APIs: Twitter, Spotify, and Open Movie Database (OMDb). It allows the user to search for song data, movie data, other people's tweets, their own tweets, and to post new tweets. It also allows for a random action pulled from a .txt file.</p>
            <p>As a CLI app, this is not deployable, but there is a .gif on the GitHub page demonstrating functionality.</p>
